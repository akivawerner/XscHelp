Help ToolKit for Motif Build and Installation Instructions

Building the library
--------------------
The Help ToolKit for Motif(tm) is distributed as ANSI C source code and must 
be compiled on your system. Imake is used to attempt to provide a portable 
build mechanism.  If the imake installation on your system is incorrect or 
omitted, then you will need to manually build the components.  

Configuring the build
---------------------
The file XscHelp.tmpl is used to configure the build.  You should examine is 
carefully and make any appropriate changes before building the library. 

Creating the makefiles
----------------------
Once the XscHelp.tmpl file has been examined and/or modified, you can build 
the distribution with the following commands:

   xmkmf
   make World

This will build the product and any example programs included in the 
distribution.  If you want to capture the build output, use the following 
commands instead:

   xmkmf
   make World >& makelog &
   tail -f makelog
   
If the xmkmf script is not installed on your system, replace it with the 
following command:

   imake -DuseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config
   
If you do not have imake installed on your system, then the product will 
need to be built manually.  

Installing the product
----------------------
Once the product has been built, you can install the library, header files, 
example programs, and the XscHelp.tmpl file by typing the following command 
in the top level product directory:

   make -k install

If you only want to install the libraries and header files, change directories 
to the 'source' directory and type the "make install" command there.

The libraries and header files are installed in the directories specified by 
the XSCHELP_LIBDIR and XSCHELP_INCDIR variables set in the XscHelp.tmpl file.  
Remember that you will need to have superuser access to install the product 
in the system directories.

Compiling and linking with the product
--------------------------------------
To compile a program that uses the Help ToolKit for Motif, the compiler must 
be able to locate the header files.  This will happen automatically if the 
header files are installed in the directory /usr/include/Xsc.  However, if 
it is in another location, such as /usr/X11R6/include/Xsc, then you may have 
to specify the location on the compiler command line as shown below:

   gcc -c -I/usr/X11R6/include my_prog.c

To link programs with the Help ToolKit for Motif, you need to specify the 
desired XscHelp libraries with the -l command line argument.  You may also 
need to specify the location of the archive files with the -L command line 
argument.

The core functions in the product are located in the archive libXscHelp.a.  
The optional CDE library, available with the registered version, is called 
libXscCdeHelp.a.  Your link line, as an example, could look like the following:

   gcc -o my_prog my_prog.o -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXscHelp -lXm -lXt -lX11 -lXext
